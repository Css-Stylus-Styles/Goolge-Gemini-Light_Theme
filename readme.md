### Clean UI 

Location and uncesseary text from UI is removed to declutter the UI and make it more minimal 



### Response From Model 

To improve readability, **strong text** is highlighted with a distinct color, while *simple text* appears in a different color. This helps users easily identify important information and follow the flow of the content.





### Code Blocks

To enhance the readability of the code, syntax highlighting is used to differentiate between various elements such as keywords, strings, and comments. This is achieved by applying distinct colors to each element, making it easier to identify and understand the code.






### Tables 

Markdown tables 






### Youtube Plugin results
